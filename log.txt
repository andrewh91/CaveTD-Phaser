i tried littleJS and it seemed to lack multiple cameras, i looked up Phaser and think i'll have a go at this instead. 

as i found with the littleJS you need to run it from a server, vscode's live server should do, it explained that this is for  web browser security reasons.

so in vscode, using liveserver , which you need to download, you can use the file explorer in vscode to open your html file, you can also right click and click open in liveserver


you need to include the phaser library like so 

    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.11.0/dist/phaser.js"></script>
	
although maybe you could bundle that with the game?

so i'll just go through the tutorials on the website

make a start
somehow i was using an old version of phaser, updated it, i've made it load from my local version instead of from online
created a dot image, got that to display, next scale it

made the player dot larger, try to move it, got smooth moving, next try to get it to conform to a grid

movement for the player should be like pokemon, move one grid space with one direciton button, and you can hold it to move continuously.
in order to achieve this i have made a playerMoveTimer that decreases if above 0 and is set to a positive value (playerMoveTimerStep) when you move, you are only allowed to move when it is 0. it counts down with delta time, so if the game lags it should move the same speed - actually i should also multiply the movement distance by delta time too, cos if the game was really slow, like if the playerMoveTimerStep was lower than the game update time we would be moving less frequently, however moving more than one space at once would complicate the collision detection and you could pass through a wall, so just keep playerMoveTimerStep relatively high
this works good enough,
