i tried littleJS and it seemed to lack multiple cameras, i looked up Phaser and think i'll have a go at this instead. 

as i found with the littleJS you need to run it from a server, vscode's live server should do, it explained that this is for  web browser security reasons.

so in vscode, using liveserver , which you need to download, you can use the file explorer in vscode to open your html file, you can also right click and click open in liveserver


you need to include the phaser library like so 

    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.11.0/dist/phaser.js"></script>
	
although maybe you could bundle that with the game?

so i'll just go through the tutorials on the website
