i tried littleJS and it seemed to lack multiple cameras, i looked up Phaser and think i'll have a go at this instead. 

as i found with the littleJS you need to run it from a server, vscode's live server should do, it explained that this is for  web browser security reasons.

so in vscode, using liveserver , which you need to download, you can use the file explorer in vscode to open your html file, you can also right click and click open in liveserver


you need to include the phaser library like so 

    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.11.0/dist/phaser.js"></script>
	
although maybe you could bundle that with the game?

so i'll just go through the tutorials on the website
https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1

make a start
somehow i was using an old version of phaser, updated it, i've made it load from my local version instead of from online
created a dot image, got that to display, next scale it

20241121
made the player dot larger, try to move it, got smooth moving, next try to get it to conform to a grid
20241122
movement for the player should be like pokemon, move one grid space with one direciton button, and you can hold it to move continuously.
in order to achieve this i have made a playerMoveTimer that decreases if above 0 and is set to a positive value (playerMoveTimerStep) when you move, you are only allowed to move when it is 0. it counts down with delta time, so if the game lags it should move the same speed - actually i should also multiply the movement distance by delta time too, cos if the game was really slow, like if the playerMoveTimerStep was lower than the game update time we would be moving less frequently, however moving more than one space at once would complicate the collision detection and you could pass through a wall, so just keep playerMoveTimerStep relatively high
this works good enough,

i want to be able to create a new player character on command, created a player class, give new players a colour derived from the player's index number 
now i want to experiment with making new cameras, i already have some code that spaces the cameras out in the order i like, try and get that to work, seems to work, need to make the borders look right though 

20241126 
playing with these cameras again, took a while but i got it to display a border around each camera. this border is in a separate scene for the UI. next i should test what removing cameras does, will this mess everything up?

20241127
added code to remove the cameras one by one, except the first camera, then redraw the borders and manage the camera positions again, seems to work well. i've also used set scroll to have the new camera target the passed in coords, which is the newly created player. #

so far the arrow keys move the player, press p to create a new player at the current player's position, with their own camera, the camera points at the new player. press r to remove the most recent camera. 

the players all use the arrow keys to move, and they spawn on top of each other, so they all always overlap. new players should have their own movement keys instead, or at least have a key to toggle the selected player.

i've created a dialog box that appears when you create a new player, new cursor keys are then assigned to this new player, this works. currently it's just the wasd keys that are given to the new player, but i want them to be user defined

next i will create a bit more dialog, saying something like, set new player movement keys, LEFT: RIGHT: UP: DOWN 
then i need to take the user input for those events and have it set up the keys 

20241128
created the dialog box for new player, instruct user to assign keys to the player, figured out how to take the user entered key and store that as that new player's movement key

so now the p key will create a new player, and a camera centred on that player then manage the positions of the cameras and add borders, then it will show a ui dialog box prompting the user to enter keys for the new player, these keys update on the screen as you do so, and are then bound to that player, seems to work well 

next i should comment the code!

adding some comments to the code

i want to create a tile class and have an array of these to create the map. so far i have just created a load of random coloured tiles, i need to create a map, the tiles need to have a terrain value dictating if the player can traverse it etc
